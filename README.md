# Inventory-Management-System

This project aims to create an Inventory Management System.
We can perform tasks like adding new products, displaying the products available in the inventory, increasing the quantity of a certain product in the inventory, keeping a tally of all the products purchased and the time they have been purchased at.

Created loops for adding and purchasing one or more products at the same time.

Made a "record.json" file to store the data (product id, name, price, quantity) of all the produts avalable in the inventory.

Made a "sales.json" file to store the data (sl. number, product id, quantity, time of purchase) of the purchase made.

## Libraries used: 
- time
- json
